                <p class="for-a-rrh">
                  For a RRH system designed for direct use of water, a filter is
                  the most important component, like the heart in a human body.
                  My filter (brand named ‘Rainy FL-100’ was purchased from a
                  rainwater harvesting company in Bangalore, see
                  www.rainyfilters.com) works on the principle of centrifugal
                  force. Once the water enters this filter, it rotates in a
                  spiral motion on the inner surface of the cylindrical shaped
                  filter mesh.
                </p>
                <p class="water-that-passes">
                  Water that passes through the mesh (along with dust particles
                  of less than 200 micron) enters the storage tank. About 10-20%
                  of water, depending on the intensity of rainfall, gets
                  rejected by the  filter. Passing of 80-90% of roof water
                  through the filter indicates very good and satisfactory
                  performance.
                </p>
                <p class="but-the-water">
                  But, the water that reaches the storage tank has still some
                  finer dust particles, which could not be removed by the
                  filter. There are also practices of using simple bucket
                  filters filled with sand, charcoal like material or sponge.
                  Most such systems require a provision for 'first-flush' to
                  prevent entry of dirt and dust into the filter. Also, such
                  filters require frequent cleanup or replacement of filter
                  material.
                </p>
                <p class="i-found-the">
                  I found the new filter to be really 'maintenance-free' and
                  there is also no need for manual operation to divert the
                  first-flush. But, the downside is during first 5-10 minutes of
                  rain, amount of water rejected is more due to high dirt-load
                  in the first-flush water. Over a period of 20-30 min, the rate
                  of rejected water comes to approx. 5- 10% of total water
                  harvested.

                  <b>Quality of water harvested</b>
                </p>
                <p class="rainwater-that-is">
                  Rainwater that is harvested through the filter reaches the
                  storage tank. During the four-months observation period, my
                  1000 L capacity storage tank got filled up around 15 times and
                  when it is filled up completely, excess water was sent out
                  through the over-flow pipe provided at the top (few inches
                  below the ground level) of the storage tank.
                </p>
                <p class="a-pipe-suction">
                  A pipe (suction pipe for the pump-set) is inserted to the
                  bottom of the storage tank (few inches above the bottom of the
                  tank) for pumping the water to the over-head tank located on
                  the roof. Since most of the dust particles are minute in size
                  and initially float on the surface of the water due
                  to turbulence, clear water free from any dust or dirt could be
                  pumped out from the bottom of the tank and the quality was
                  found to be highly satisfactory.
                </p>
                <p class="moreover-repeated-filling">
                  Moreover, repeated filling of the storage tank to the brim
                  helped in sending out the water loaded with floating dust
                  particles through the over-flow pipe. Thus the system is
                  functioning like a ‘self-cleaning and maintaining’ system.
                  Dust particles got clustered and floating on the water surface
                  in storage tank (immediately after a rainfall event). For any
                  such RRH to function as a self-cleaning and self-flushing with
                  minimum human intervention for maintenance, it is useful to
                  size the storage tank in such a way that it over-flows several
                  times during the rainy season.
                </p>
                <p class="moreover-due-to">
                  Moreover, due to availability of limited space for
                  constructing a tank, it is better to construct a tank of
                  2000-3000 litre capacity or less for a roof area of 100 sq.m
                  in a place like Hyderabad. In places with more intense rains,
                  one can go for higher capacity storage tanks. But, to avoid
                  wastage of more water through over-flow, one need frequently
                  pump out water and keep the storage tank empty.
                </p>
                <p class="few-days-after">
                  Few days after the rainfall, I observed relatively bigger dust
                  particles settling at the bottom of the storage tank. Since
                  pumping is done from a level few inches above the bottom of
                  tank, most of these particles flock together and do not move
                  with water pumped to the over-head tank. Flushing the storage
                  tank once in a season will help to remove them and keep the
                  tank clean.

                  <b>Conclusion</b>
                </p>
                <p class="the-over-all-performance">
                  The over-all performance of the RRH system is found to be good
                  and satisfactory. Filter’s performance, which influences the
                  quality of water and functioning of whole system, is found to
                  be very good. Careful sizing of the storage tank and proper
                  over-flow provision to storage tank helps to make the system
                  ‘self-cleaning’ and ‘self-maintaining’.
                </p>
                <p class="my-rrh-system">
                  My RRH system helped to harvest around 15,000 liters of water
                  over a period of 5 months (150 days), at an average rate of
                  100 liters per day. In other words, 15,000 litres of drinking
                  water supplied by the muncipality was prevented from going
                  down the drain as toilet flush and saved so as to meet
                  drinking water needs of people in other areas.
                </p>
                <p class="by-adopting-roof">
                  By adopting roof top water harvesting and implementing dual
                  water use by modifying the household level plumbing works, one
                  can save lot of high-value treated drinking water and help
                  people in accessing potable water in areas facing serious
                  water shortage and also in areas (such as Nalagonda) affected
                  by fluoride in water.
